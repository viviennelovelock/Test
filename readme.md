Project #0: The Game

- Brief explanation of assessment

It would seem to be a simple game of tic-tac-toe, but it is so much more. This is a culmination of my (few) javascript, jQuery, html and css skills, as of Week 3 at least.

- How you tackle problems

Pseudo coding is still my best friend. Css is till my enemy.

- Explain any tricky code or weird (?), choices you made.



- Note any improvements or ideas for future.



- THANK YOU
