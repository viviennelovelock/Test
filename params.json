This is a culmination of my (few) javascript, jQuery, html and css skills, as of Week 3 at least.\r\n\r\n- How you tackle problems\r\n\r\nPseudo coding is still my best friend. Css is still my enemy.\r\n\r\n- Explain any tricky code or weird (?), choices you made.\r\n\r\n   -    -\r\n\r\n- Note any improvements or ideas for future.\r\n\r\nWould have liked to spend more time on css and styling.\r\n\r\n- THANK YOU\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
